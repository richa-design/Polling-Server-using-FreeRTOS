# Polling-Server-using-FreeRTOS

The project involves the implementation of the Rate Monotonic Scheduling algorithm with integrated Polling Server to service aperiodic job requests using an open-source FreeRTOS platform. The project involves C++ implementation of both the algorithms and a complete analysis of these algorithms from a performance standpoint. For the implementation and analysis part of the project, Arduino Mega 2560 hardware is used to run, debug, and verify the algorithms.
